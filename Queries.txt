i'm a developer, generate a java test units for me to test this class,

package com.example;
import com.shapes.*;

/**
 * Hello world!
 *
 */
public class App 
{
    public static void main( String[] args )

    {


        Hello hello = new Hello("Hello World!");
        hello.printMessage();

        hello.setMessage("Welcome to java!! from setter method");
        hello.printMessage();

        // Rectangle length = 10, width = 20
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);
        System.out.println("Area of rectangle: " + rectangle.getArea());
        System.out.println("Perimeter of rectangle: " + rectangle.getPerimeter());

        // Circle radius = 10
        Circle circle = new Circle(10);
        System.out.println("Area of circle: " + circle.getArea());
        System.out.println("Circumference of circle: " + circle.getCircumference());

    }
}


knowing that i'm working on linux and i'm using maven for my project structure and also to build my project.

For documentation:
1- This is a sample documentation for the com.example.App class. Can you provide a sample documentation for the com.example.App class?
2- I am a beginner in Java programming and I am trying to understand how to write documentation for my classes. I have a simple Java application that I would like to document, but I am not sure how to structure the documentation. Can you provide a sample documentation for the com.example.App class? I would like to see how to document the constructors, methods, variables, and main method of the class. Thank you for your help.
